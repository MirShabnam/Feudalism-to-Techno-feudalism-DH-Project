# TechnoFeudalism-DH-Project

A complete Digital Humanities project that critically compares **historical feudalism** with **contemporary techno-feudalism**, showing how core patterns — **enclosure, rent extraction, and private jurisdiction** — reappear in a new technological form.

## Highlights
- Reproducible data tables in `data/`
- Publication-ready essay and policy brief in `reports/`
- TEI-encoded samples in `tei/`
- Visuals in `visuals/` (auto-generated from `src/make_plots.py`)
- A Jupyter notebook in `notebooks/` to explore and recreate analysis
- Minimal static site (`index.html`) for GitHub Pages

## Quick Start
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. (Optional) Regenerate charts:
   ```bash
   python3 src/make_plots.py
   ```
3. Open `reports/essay.md` for the full analysis.
4. Serve `index.html` with GitHub Pages to preview the comparison.
