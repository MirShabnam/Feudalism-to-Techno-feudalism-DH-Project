Feudalism vs Techno-Feudalism is a Digital Humanities research project that examines how the medieval logic of rent, hierarchy, and control has resurfaced in the digital era through platform power, data ownership, and algorithmic governance.

Combining philosophy, critical theory, and computational methods, it reveals that history has not ended — it has been re-encoded.
Land became data, castles became clouds, and fiefs became platforms.

⚙️ A reflection on how humanity repeats its structures of domination — this time, in code.
