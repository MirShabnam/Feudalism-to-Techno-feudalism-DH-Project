# Interpretation — Why Praxis Faded into Theory? And: Do We Need Another Marx?

**Thesis**: Marxism’s historical arc shows **high‑intensity action** in foundational moments (1848, 1871, 1917, 1959, 1968) but an **increasing dominance of theoretical production** afterward. This does not mean theory is “mere abstraction” — rather, the *balance* between praxis and critique shifted as movements institutionalized and global capitalism evolved.

**Readings**
- **Praxis Peaks**: 1848, 1871, 1917, 1959, 1968 register as action‑heavy periods.
- **Theoretical Consolidation**: Post‑Marx concepts trend toward *ideology, subjectivity, discourse, hegemony, apparatus*.
- **Why unrealized?** Fragmentation of labor, state capture, mass‑media logics, and digital platforms diffuse collective agency.
- **Another Marx?** Perhaps the question is **not** “another Marx,” but a **Marx‑scale synthesis** adequate to platform capitalism and data rent — a praxis that translates critical theory into institutional change.
