# Policy Brief: Preventing a Techno-feudal Drift

**Date:** 2025-10-28

**Thesis:** Digital infrastructure is concentrating rent-extraction and private jurisdiction. Public policy must restore interoperability, portability, and due process while enabling open commons and collective bargaining.

**Recommendations:**
- **Interoperability-by-default** through protocol mandates.
- **App-store unbundling** and alternative payments.
- **Data portability** and **fiduciary data trusts**.
- **Cloud switching rights** and **egress fee caps**.
- **Public/sovereign compute** and support for open models.
- **Algorithmic audit rights** and **appeals in moderation**.
- **Collective bargaining** frameworks for gig/creator/developer classes.
